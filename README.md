# bmi_simulation

With specifications provided by the CSDP (Brookings Institution), I replicated a small-scale version of an agent-based model (originally developed by Hammond and Ornstein) that simulates how a population shifts their BMIs according to each person’s social network. While various parameters a↵ect the specifics of the distributions, overall, BMI trends upwards across the population over time when only considering network factors. This was an assessment for a hiring task.
